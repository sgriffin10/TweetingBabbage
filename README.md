## Materials Needed
We relied a lot on the resources at the Weissmen Foundry where we were able to find all of the equipment we needed for free. ** Bolded components: Not provided by Foundry  
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Mini Computer 
- Camera Module 
- USB Adapter
- Micro USB 
- Micro USB Adapter
- **HDMI**
- **USB Keyboard** 
- **Mouse**
- **Professor Li**


## How to Create the Bear?
We used all of these requirements including the tutorial pages from Raspberry Pi to teach us how to: 
- Write the code that programmed the Raspberry Pi and Camera to take picture
- Install the required packages for Raspberry Pi ( NOOBS )
- Format the Micro USB using an SD Formatter in order to empty its content
- Power on the Raspberry Pi by connecting: 
  - HDMI to Moniter (TV), 
  - USB Power adapter, 
  - Keyboard,
  - Mouse, and
  - Camera Module
- Boot the Raspberry Pi using LINUX
- Learn how to push changes of the code to Github for collaboration using LINUX command line 
- Take Pictures 
- How to upload to Twitter 

## 3. Stitch open the Bear 

In this process, we had to stuff the Raspberry Pi gadget into the stuffed animal in order to make it inconspicuous. Therefore the Camera could not be seen. 

## 4. See Results: 

After all of this was done, we were able to take a picture, and have a randomize status attached to it before it uploads to Twitter. 
The random statuses it could choose from  are:

"Looking Fresh, keeping  it cash", 

 "Hello, World! I'm a Dub!", 
 
 "DM me if you think I'm a 10",
 
 "I belong on Reddit's r/hotpics", 
 
 "Come on, you know I'm a dub",
 
 "G's Only!!"
